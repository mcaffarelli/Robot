# Robot-C++
The project defines a Robot class and commands the robot to move to different locations within a 10 X 10 grid. The robot is able to pickup and drop off loads in different cells of the grid. The loads are represented as letters 'C' and letter 'B'. The robot is not displayed on the grid but you can see the robots current location via coordinates.

Below are the screenshots of the program running:


This is showing 2 robots moving from one location to the next shown via coordinates. Each robot is moving to a different location and picking up/dropping off a load placed in the 10 X 10 Grid.
